== Patent Information Database

The CalConnect Patent Information Database is a public register for the disclosure of
potential patent information relating to CalConnect standardization deliverables.

This patent information database is created in accordance with
Clause 5.7 of link:/cc/cc-dir10005-2019[CC/DIR 10005] ("Patent information database").

[quote]
____
In order to facilitate both the standards-making process and the application of deliverables, CalConnect makes available to the public a patent information database composed of information that was communicated to CalConnect by the means of declaration forms.
____


== Intended usage

statements about patent policy compliance for particular deliverables.

that they may wish to contact the entities who have communicated declaration forms to CalConnect
in order to determine if patent licenses must be obtained for use or implementation of a
particular deliverable.
